"A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having".The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.
You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching.Does dancing make you happy? Does it make you feel carefree? Dance to the rhythm of your heart, and you will feel happiness like never before. It does not matter whether you like jazz or jive or salsa or folk. What matters is that your heart loves to dance.Gather spirit full of enthusiasm and jump onto the dance floor awaiting for only you.
